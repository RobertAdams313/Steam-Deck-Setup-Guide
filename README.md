<!--Remember to add the emulators that you need to manually install via the Discover store.-->


## [RetroDECK](https://retrodeck.net)
Another all-in-one emulator except this one uses the front-end of EmulationStation. 
<!--Look up differences between this and Emudeck.-->

Note: 



# Remote Play
<!--Think about adding performance of each? Or keep this install centered only? -->

## [Chikai4deck](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck)
<!-- describe the process for installing and how to set it up. -->
A PS4/PS5 remote play app. 
<!-- Include screenshots of deck. Find out how to "put screenshot in photo of deck"-->

## [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org)
<!-- describe how to install and set up. -->
Moonlight utilizes Gamesteam  to trick your PC into thinking the streaming device is a Nvidia Shield so you can stream any of your games. You can also use this as a Remote Desktop application by adding mstsc.exe to the Shield tab in Geforce Experience. 

<!--Should I do a nested list here highlighting the process for installing on host/steam deck, configuration, recommended settings, recommended controller config, 

Gamestream allows you to stream any of your games from your PC using a Nvidia GTX or RTX graphics card. Using high speed, low latency video encoders built into GTX/RTX GPUs It's intended use is for you to stream your games to a Nvidia Shield TV or Shield Tablet. 


Note: Nvidia has announced they are dropping GameStreat from the Shield starting *check date* which will not essentially kill Moonlight's current functionality. 

## [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)
Sunshine is a Gamestream host for Moonlight. This removes the need to have a Nvidia graphics card so if you're using an AMD card this is what you'll need to use Moonlight. 
<!-- Explain how this would replace GameStream but it is not as reliable and performs worse.-->

## [Greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/xbox-xcloud-client)
Greenlight is an Xbox Remote Play app. Not to be confused with xCloud. This is used to connect directly to your Xbox.
