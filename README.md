# Tips
## Turn off adaptive brightness

<!--Kills the battery. Use QAM for brightness changes.-->

# Don't be afraid to use the built in limiter

In the QAM you get an option between locking it at 15 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps. You can also lock it to 40 fps but only after you change the refresh rate to 40 as well.

<!--40hz with 40 fps is better than FPS jumping between 40-60. It also looks surprisingly smooth and keeps the battery lasting longer. Use CPU/GPU limiter and you can save these settings per game. -->


# Easier File Transfers
## [AnyDesk](https://www.anydesk.com)
AnyDesk is a remote desktop application  one of the best and easiest ways to navigate the Steam Deck while in Desktop mode. It's free and it'll share the mouse/keyboard and clipboard with your actual PC. The best part is it's multiplatform. It's available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi and Chrome OS.  

## Enable SSH

Enabling SSH is useful for file transfering purposes via FTP applications such as WinSCP, etc <!--Look up other examples-->

## KDE Connect
As of software version 3.4.4 KDE was updated to support KDE Connect which allows you to -- <!--Look for examples--> The functionality is built into the OS. Just download KDE connect on the device you'd like to transfer files from. <!--Find supported OS's-->

# Emulation
## [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com)![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34931118/213895041-d8c051e5-850f-4c43-93b7-0f630c37cdd7.png)

An all-in-one emulation installer. It'll set-up the file structure needed for every emulator so you can just start and go.

Another all-in-one emulator except this one uses the front-end of EmulationStation. 
<!--Look up differences between this and Emudeck.-->

Note: 



# Remote Play
<!--Think about adding performance of each? Or keep this install centered only? -->

## [Chiaki4deck](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck)![chiaki_wide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34931118/213895158-7a678b9f-a117-44ed-8496-d915b54e5550.png)

<!-- describe the process for installing and how to set it up. -->
A PS4/PS5 remote play app. 
<!-- Include screenshots of deck. Find out how to "put screenshot in photo of deck"-->

## [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org)
<!-- describe how to install and set up. -->
Moonlight utilizes Gamesteam  to trick your PC into thinking the streaming device is a Nvidia Shield so you can stream any of your games. You can also use this as a Remote Desktop application by adding mstsc.exe to the Shield tab in Geforce Experience. 

<!--Should I do a nested list here highlighting the process for installing on host/steam deck, configuration, recommended settings, recommended controller config, --> 

Gamestream allows you to stream any of your games from your PC using a Nvidia GTX or RTX graphics card. Using high speed, low latency video encoders built into GTX/RTX GPUs It's intended use is for you to stream your games to a Nvidia Shield TV or Shield Tablet. 


Note: Nvidia has announced they are dropping GameStreat from the Shield starting *check date* which will not essentially kill Moonlight's current functionality. 

## MoonDeck
<!--downloaded from Deckyloader store. Show how to do that or maybe show the store in the seperate deckyloader section. Link to that from here.-->

## [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)
Sunshine is a Gamestream host for Moonlight. This removes the need to have a Nvidia graphics card so if you're using an AMD card this is what you'll need to use Moonlight. 
<!-- Explain how this would replace GameStream but it is not as reliable and performs worse.-->

## [Greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/xbox-xcloud-client)
Greenlight is an Xbox Remote Play app. Not to be confused with xCloud. This is used to connect directly to your Xbox.
